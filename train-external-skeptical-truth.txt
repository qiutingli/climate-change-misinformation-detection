Through its impacts on the climate, CO2 presents a danger to public health and welfare, and thus qualifies as an air pollutant

If every nation agrees to limit CO2 emissions, we can achieve significant cuts on a global scale.

Negative impacts of global warming on agriculture, health & environment far outweigh any positives.

The last decade 2000-2009 was the hottest on record.

97% of climate experts agree humans are causing global warming.

Climate reacts to whatever forces it to change at the time; humans are now the dominant forcing.

Every part of the Earth's climate system has continued warming since 1998, with 2015 shattering temperature records.

If every nation agrees to limit CO2 emissions, we can achieve significant cuts on a global scale.

There is long-term correlation between CO2 and global temperature; other effects are short-term.

The last decade 2000-2009 was the hottest on record.

Negative impacts of global warming on agriculture, health & environment far outweigh any positives.

If every nation agrees to limit CO2 emissions, we can achieve significant cuts on a global scale.

The benefits of a price on carbon outweigh the costs several times over.

The benefits of a price on carbon outweigh the costs several times over.

Extreme weather events are being made more frequent and worse by global warming.

Sea level rise is now increasing faster than predicted due to unexpectedly rapid ice melting.

The most recent ocean measurements show consistent warming.

Global temperature is still rising and 2010 was the hottest recorded.

The effects of enhanced CO2 on terrestrial plants are variable and complex and dependent on numerous factors

Through its impacts on the climate, CO2 presents a danger to public health and welfare, and thus qualifies as an air pollutant

This argument ignores the cooling effect of aerosols and the planet's thermal inertia.

Internal variability can only account for small amounts of warming and cooling over periods of decades, and scientific studies have consistently shown that it cannot account for the global warming over the past century.

Multiple sets of independent observations find a human fingerprint on climate change.

Every part of the Earth's climate system has continued warming since 1998, with 2015 shattering temperature records.

There are multiple lines of direct observations that humans are causing global warming.
